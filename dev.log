hi :)
warning: this log contains opinions. you may choose to turn back if you hate opinions.

day smth i forgor: i make game


dev.log made, i feel like 
day 1: 9/21/23
i make bg yaey


day 2: 9/22/23
i play brawl stars with alex (i had quests in boss fight, we got to insane 17 iirc)
rmb edgar + colt is op strat


day 3: 9/23/23
made the control system
i have to think long term
idk how long, but rn im forseeing controller support
i expected just textures and sound
WHY DO I THINK SO LONG TERM

rn i feel like im just one person writing an entire company's code
must be a small company then
did i mention that im on plane rn

control system: no momentum, wasd/arrows move (i want 2p support also, so this system is def gon change
ok i done making the player move
i go play minecraft now

im back from minecraft, time to code
the sky is dark
now that i think of it, when was the last time i started on a non-platformer game
when was the last time i started a game at all
its been so long that i forgot
then again, my memory's quite bad
also if i had to write an essay showing my development process, im gon be real thankful for this.
devlog > diary 
im switching my font back; comic mono is pretty good and all, but its time to go
one day ima write so much that tabnine and my editor can train themselves and write the log for me.
rn its helping me a lot when i code
(if you dont know what tabnine is, its a extension for vscode that autocompletes for you, and its helping me a lot)
just switched, back to comic mono i go
anyway where was I

changed bg to a slightly more greenish color
the player is now white
added enemy class, its red #FF7777

just realised theres no cs in ib afaik
which means i have to study cs myself
yaaaaaaay...

im back
my laptops on 34%
how long has it been
ive lost track of time
ITS 19:38 
im at a loss of words
anyway

enemy shows up on screen
it can target nearest player now
(i hope, i havent added another player yet...)
enemy renders infront of player, fixed!
now it renders behind
it already has the feel of a game i made for a school project back in year 9
that was a space shooter, you moved around and rocks spawned around the map and tried to crash into you
(tabnine suggested "your house" instead of "you" lololololololollllllllllllllll)
tbh i dont think future entries would be as detailed as this
mainly cuz now i have 5+ hrs of nonstop coding yaey
should i put a warning on top to show that this log contains opinions
that was not a question. i just did.
tbf all i gotta do is correct the grammar, fix the paragraphs and im done
not gon say writing this log improves writing skills tho, im just documenting stuff

i used the bg pic, finally
prob should start a local commit now
